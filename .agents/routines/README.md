# Claude Code Routines

Routines put Claude Code on autopilot against this repo, running on
Anthropic-managed cloud infrastructure at
[claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines).

This directory holds the committed half of each routine: prompt and
setup script. The saved configuration at claude.ai is kept thin and
points back at these files, so iteration happens in the repo.

## Identity — read this first

Routines are owned by whichever claude.ai account **created** them.
That account's subscription burns tokens on every run, and its linked
GitHub identity is what commits appear as. For AdCP we want
`brian@agenticadvertising.org`.

1. In your Claude Code CLI, run `/status`. If not on that account,
   `/login`. Then `/web-setup` to sync GitHub auth.
2. Install the [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude) on
   `adcontextprotocol/adcp-go` under the GitHub identity you want
   commits to appear as.

## Setup

1. **Create the routine** at
   [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines) or via
   `/schedule` in the CLI:
   - **Name:** `adcp-go — issue triage`
   - **Prompt:** the minimal launcher below
   - **Repository:** `adcontextprotocol/adcp-go`; leave branch pushes
     restricted to `claude/*`
   - **Environment:** new env, paste `environment-setup.sh`; Trusted
     network access
   - **Schedule trigger:** every 6 hours

   Launcher prompt:

   ```
   You are the adcp-go issue-triage agent. Read these in order, then
   act:

     1. AGENTS.md          — project conventions + TEE guardrails
     2. .agents/routines/triage-prompt.md  — triage behavior

   If a user message below contains issue context, act on that
   issue. Otherwise walk the open-issue queue.
   ```

2. **Add an API trigger** → copy URL, generate token (shown once).
3. **Repo secrets:** `CLAUDE_ROUTINE_TRIAGE_URL`,
   `CLAUDE_ROUTINE_TRIAGE_TOKEN`.
4. Bridge workflow at `.github/workflows/claude-issue-triage.yml`
   fires `/fire` on `issues.opened`/`reopened`.

## Auto-fix

For Claude-opened PRs, enable auto-fix via the CI status bar on the
PR (or `/autofix-pr` locally while on the branch). Requires the
Claude GitHub App.
