# AdCP Request Signing Conformance Vectors

Test vectors for the AdCP RFC 9421 request-signing profile. These fixtures drive cross-implementation conformance testing so a signer written in one SDK and a verifier written in another agree on the wire format.

Specification: [Signed Requests (Transport Layer)](https://adcontextprotocol.org/docs/building/implementation/security#signed-requests-transport-layer) in `docs/building/implementation/security.mdx`.

**Canonical URLs.** These vectors are served at `https://adcontextprotocol.org/test-vectors/request-signing/` (tree preserved — `keys.json`, `negative/*.json`, `positive/*.json` all resolvable). SDKs SHOULD fetch from the CDN path rather than requiring a checkout of the spec repo. Example: `https://adcontextprotocol.org/test-vectors/request-signing/positive/001-basic-post.json`.

## Scope

These vectors exercise the [verifier checklist](https://adcontextprotocol.org/docs/building/implementation/security#verifier-checklist-requests) and the RFC 9421 profile constraints: covered components, signature parameters, tag namespace, alg allowlist, `adcp_use` key-purpose discriminator, replay dedup, revocation, and content-digest semantics. They do not exercise live JWKS fetch, brand.json discovery, or revocation-list polling — those require live endpoints and belong in integration suites.

## Vector format

Every vector is a single JSON file with this shape:

```json
{
  "name": "human-readable description",
  "spec_reference": "#anchor in security.mdx (checklist step or pre-check)",
  "reference_now": 1776520800,
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "https://seller.example.com/adcp/create_media_buy",
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Signature-Input": "sig1=(...)",
      "Signature": "sig1=:base64url_signature:",
      "Content-Digest": "sha-256=:base64url_digest:"
    },
    "body": "{\"...\":\"...\"}"
  },
  "verifier_capability": {

```

### Fields

- **`name`** — one-line description.
- **`spec_reference`** — anchor in `security.mdx` the vector tests, including the checklist step number.
- **`reference_now`** — Unix seconds. Treat as the wall-clock value the verifier should use when evaluating the signature window. Inject into your test harness rather than using `Date.now()`.
- **`request`** — the raw HTTP request the verifier receives. `headers` is case-insensitive; `body` is the exact byte string on the wire (empty string for GETs).
- **`verifier_capability`** — the `request_signing` block the verifier advertises. Drives expected behavior on content-digest coverage (`"required"` | `"forbidden"` | `"either"`) and whether unsigned requests to the operation are rejected pre-check.
- **`jwks_ref`** — array of `kid` strings from `keys.json`. The test harness builds the verifier's view of the signing agent's JWKS by selecting those entries. Present on most vectors.
- **`jwks_override`** — full JWKS object (`{ keys: [...] }`) that replaces the default `jwks_ref` lookup for this vector. Used when a vector needs a JWK that is NOT in the canonical `keys.json` (e.g., a malformed `key_ops` to test step 8 rejection). Mutually exclusive with `jwks_ref`.
- **`test_harness_state`** — optional. Preloads verifier state BEFORE invoking verification. Harness implementations translate each sub-key into the appropriate concrete preload for their verifier under test. Supported sub-keys:
  - `replay_cache_entries` — list of `{ keyid, nonce, ttl_seconds }` to preload into the per-`(keyid, nonce)` replay cache. Used by `016-replayed-nonce.json` to assert the nonce-dedup check at step 12.
  - `replay_cache_per_keyid_cap_hit` — object `{ keyid }` signalling the per-keyid entry cap is hit for the named key. Used by `020-rate-abuse.json` to assert the cap check at step 9a. The harness MAY simulate by populating the cache with N placeholder entries (where N equals the verifier's configured cap) or by setting an implementation-private flag — what the vector asserts is the rejection behavior when the cap is hit, not the mechanism of reaching it.
  - `revocation_list` — full signed-revocation-list object to preload as the current freshness snapshot. Used by `017-key-revoked.json` to assert the revocation check at step 9.
- **`expected_signature_base`** — present on positive vectors and on `015-signature-invalid.json`. The canonical signature base string per RFC 9421 §2.5. Shape specifics that implementers get wrong: **lines are joined with a single `\n`** (LF, not CRLF); **there is no trailing newline** after the final `@signature-params` line; **components appear in the exact order listed in `Signature-Input`**, followed by `@signature-params` as the last line. The JSON string uses `\n` escapes which parse to real newline bytes at load time. Implementers can diff their computed base against this field BEFORE worrying about signatures — canonicalization disagreements are the #1 source of 9421 interop bugs, and checking the base is how you catch them.
- **`expected_outcome.success`** — `true` for positive vectors, `false` for negative.
- **`expected_outcome.error_code`** — stable code from the [transport error taxonomy](https://adcontextprotocol.org/docs/building/implementation/security#transport-error-taxonomy). Conformance requires **byte-for-byte match** on this code. Negative vectors only.
- **`expected_outcome.failed_step`** — which step of the verifier checklist the rejection occurs at. Integer for numbered steps (`1`–`13`), or a string for lettered sub-steps (e.g. `"9a"` for the per-keyid cap check). Informational only — an implementation that rejects with the correct error code is conformant even if its internal step numbering differs. An implementation that rejects with a DIFFERENT error code is non-conformant (see [Conformance expectations](#conformance-expectations)). Negative vectors only.
- **`$comment`** — free-form clarifying notes. Some vectors use `$comment` to describe test-harness setup or conformance edge cases.

## Test keypairs

`keys.json` ships three keypairs used across the vectors:

| kid | alg | adcp_use | purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test-ed25519-2026` | EdDSA (Ed25519) | `request-signing` | primary signing key for Ed25519 positive vectors |
| `test-es256-2026` | ES256 | `request-signing` | edge-runtime variant; covers ES256 |
| `test-gov-2026` | EdDSA (Ed25519) | `governance-signing` | included to test the cross-purpose rejection rule at checklist step 8 (vector `009-key-ops-missing-verify` presents this key when verifying a request signature) |

The private-key halves are present in `keys.json` as `_private_d_for_test_only` so implementations can regenerate positive-vector signatures deterministically. **These keypairs are for conformance testing only. They are public knowledge and MUST NOT be used in any production capacity.**

## Conformance expectations

An implementation is conformant when, for every vector:

1. **Negative vectors** produce `expected_outcome.error_code` exactly. The `failed_step` is informational: an implementation that rejects with the correct error code is conformant, even if its internal step numbering differs. An implementation that rejects with a DIFFERENT error code (even at the right step) is non-conformant.
2. **Positive vectors** verify without error.
3. **Signature bytes on positive vectors** match `request.headers.Signature` byte-for-byte when the implementation signs with the corresponding key from `keys.json`. Ed25519 is deterministic (001 and 002 will reproduce byte-exact). ES256 uses IEEE P1363 (r||s) encoding per RFC 9421 §3.3.2; ECDSA is non-deterministic by default, so implementations that use random-k are conformant on VERIFY but may not reproduce the `Signature` byte-for-byte. Verifiers are the protocol surface — reproduction of signer bytes is a convenience check, not a normative requirement.

## Generating positive-vector signatures

Positive-vector signatures are computed from the canonical signature base per RFC 9421 §2.5. The base string for each positive vector is in `expected_signature_base` so implementers can check their canonicalization independently of cryptographic signing.

The shipped signatures were generated from those base strings using the corresponding private keys. Regenerator script (not shipped): `.context/generate-test-vectors.mjs` uses `jose` + Node's `node:crypto` to produce the committed outputs.

**Cross-implementation commitment check.** Before relying on the shipped signatures, SDK implementers SHOULD independently compute the signature base from the vector inputs (method, URL, headers, body, covered-components list, sig-params) and compare byte-for-byte against `expected_signature_base` in each positive vector. If all three reference SDKs (TypeScript, Go, Python — see adcp#2323 for tracking issues) agree with the committed base, confidence that the committed `Signature` values are canonical is high. If any disagrees, escalate to the spec repo BEFORE the SDK consumes the signatures — locking a canonicalization bug into the committed signatures would be the worst outcome, because every subsequent verifier would inherit it. The `expected_signature_base` field exists specifically to make this check byte-level and implementation-independent.

## Running vectors against an implementation

A reference harness is in progress at https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp-client/issues/575. Until it lands, implementers consuming these vectors should:

1. Parse each vector JSON.
2. Build a `Request` object from `vector.request.method`, `vector.request.url`, `vector.request.headers`, `vector.request.body`.
3. Build the verifier's JWKS from `vector.jwks_ref` (selecting entries from `keys.json`) or `vector.jwks_override` (use as-is).
4. Preload any `test_harness_state` sub-keys into the verifier's replay cache and revocation snapshot.
5. Invoke verification with `reference_now` as the wall clock, `vector.verifier_capability` as the advertised capability, and the operation name derived from the request URL or `expected_outcome.failed_step == 0`'s pre-check expectation.
6. Assert:
   - Negative: error code matches `expected_outcome.error_code` exactly.
   - Positive: verification returns successfully.

### Recommended run order

Run vectors in this order when validating a new implementation — it isolates failure categories so a bug surfaces cleanly instead of as a pile of unrelated red tests:

1. **Positive vectors first** (`positive/001`, `/002`, `/003`). These exercise the happy path. If `001` fails, your signer or verifier's canonicalization, key loading, or crypto is wrong — fix before touching anything else. The `expected_signature_base` field in each positive vector lets you diff YOUR canonical base against the spec's, independent of whether your crypto works.
2. **Parse-level negatives next** (`001`, `002`, `011`, `012`, `014`, `019`). These fail at the pre-check or early checklist steps without invoking crypto. Passing these means your header parsing and presence checks are correct.
3. **Semantic negatives** (`003`, `004`, `005`, `006`, `007`, `013`, `018`). These exercise specific rules (window, alg allowlist, covered components, content-digest policy) without requiring valid signatures.
4. **Key-path negatives** (`008`, `009`). JWKS resolution + `adcp_use` enforcement.
5. **Stateful pre-crypto negatives** (`017`, `020`). These require preloaded harness state and reject before crypto verify — `017` on revocation (step 9), `020` on the per-keyid cap (step 9a). The committed `Signature` on these vectors is a placeholder and is NOT expected to verify cryptographically; the rejection MUST land on the pre-crypto cheap check.
6. **Crypto / stateful-post negatives last** (`015`, `010`, `016`). These require the verifier to have run most of the checklist before reaching the failure point. `015` specifically catches canonicalization bugs where your implementation computes a different signature base than the spec — if you pass `positive/001` but fail `015`, your canonicalization is still off somewhere and `015` is picking it up.

## Adding vectors

Every new vector MUST:

1. Cite a specific normative requirement in `security.mdx`.
2. Identify the verifier-checklist step it exercises (or the pre-check).
3. Use only keypairs from `keys.json`, OR supply a documented `jwks_override` explaining why a non-canonical key shape is required.
4. Include `expected_signature_base` for positive vectors and for step-10 `request_signature_invalid` catchers.
5. Include `test_harness_state` for any vector that requires preloaded verifier state.
